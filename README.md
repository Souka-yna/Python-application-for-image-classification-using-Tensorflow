# Python-application-for-image-classification-using-Tensorflow

In this project, our objective is to classify images using Tensorflow only!!!
Image Classification is a method tp classify the images into their respective category classes.
We used CIFAR10 as dataset, has 10 different categories of images in it. There is a total of 60 000 images of 10 different classes naming Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship and Truck. All the images are of size 32 x 32.

As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape ( Image.height, Image.width, Color_Channels) ignoring the batch size.

My simple CNN has achieved a test accuracy of over 70% not bad for a few lines of code !!!
